# CopyDocsWithComments
This script will allow you to make copies of a Google Document with comments in your Google Drive.
If the original is in a folder, then the copies will be made in the same folder.
Be careful of what you change. Each semicolon is very important.

If you want you can open this link and then click the copy icon in the (i) Overview to get a copy of the script, instead of copy-pasting.

## INSTRUCTIONS!!!

Open the document in Google Drive that you want to copy.

Look at the URL; there is a string of weird letters and numbers; that is the document ID.

Copy the document ID and REPLACE it in the line of code below.

Notice there are single quotations around the document ID, that is important!

When you have changed the number of copies and the document ID in the script, 
you will click on the save icon and then go to the Run menu and choose copyDocs.
Authorize the script and copies will be made to your drive.

This script is only slightly altered from Alice Keeler's CopyDocs to include comments 
from the original document. If you don't want comments copied, use Alice's original.

If you copy the code and not my script, then you have to do this too:

### Enable Drive API v2 at Advanced Google Services
#### In script editor

Resources -> Advanced Google Services

Turn on Drive API v2
